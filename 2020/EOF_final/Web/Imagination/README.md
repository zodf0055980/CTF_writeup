In this challenge, each team will have an isolated environment (ssh proxy + web server), which can be accessed via ssh root@ais3eof.zoolab.org -p $[60300+TEAM_ID] with your team token as the password. You can access the web server http://imagination:8000 through the ssh proxy. See [ssh local port forwarding](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding#Local_Port_Forwarding) for help.

The flag is on the web server.
